title: Databricks Quick Start Workflow
platforms:
- Databricks
- AWS
description: A beginner-friendly workflow to create a notebook, query a sample table,
  and visualize data in Databricks using Unity Catalog.
prerequisites:
- Workspace must have Unity Catalog enabled
- Permission to use an existing compute resource or create a new compute resource
initial_state:
  workspace: Unity Catalog enabled workspace exists
  compute_resource: Permission to access or create compute resources
  notebook: No notebook created
  data_query: No query executed
  visualization: No visualization created
goal_state:
  workspace: Unity Catalog enabled workspace active
  compute_resource: Compute resource accessible
  notebook: New notebook created and attached to cluster
  data_query: Sample table queried successfully
  visualization: Bar chart visualization created for fare amount by trip distance
